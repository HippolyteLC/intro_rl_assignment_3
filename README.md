github repo for assignment 3 (introduction to reinforcement learning)

This contains the following

- Baseline:   Deep Q-Learning with epsilon-greedy strategy (done)
- Approach 1: Scrappy Adversial Training/ Adaptive Curriculum Learning - pole length frequency (not yet implemented)
- Approach 2: Scrappy Adversial Training/ Adaptive Curriculum Learning - pole length performance (implemented)
- Approach 3: Prioritized Experience Replay - sampling strategy for Replay Buffer (not yet implemented)
- Approach 4: Adaptive Reward Function Strategy (not done yet) (this one will not be)

- Tests for each of the 4 
And: 
- Comparison of the 3 approaches

To run you need to:
